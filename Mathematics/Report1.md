# Week 1

### Summary
Start to practice some mathematic assignments on the ICPC class from stanford

### Some opinion so far
1. Maybe we can formulize some method of solving problem in order to increase productivity since our speed so far is not that fast.
In example, we spent 2.5 hours for 6 problems
2. Maybe force ourselves to create java class and upload to github to keep track of what we did, and documantate all the necessary stuff

### Note
1. Remember to googld how to solve simple polymonial problem
2. Google matrix calculation method for java
3. Create a simple super class
	1. A method to calculate run-time
	2. I don't know how to calculate memory usage so far, but we can give a try

### PS
1. I found the lecture slide interesting useful to assignment so far, so maybe instead of just jumping to do assignment; maybe we can look over the slides first.
